    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Roast Dinner is a staple of British cuisine, known also as a <em>Sunday Dinner</em>,
            this meal was typically eaten on sundays and consists of a roast meat, yorkshire puddings, gravy, stuffing
            roast potatoes and a variety of vegetables, notably brussel sprouts.
        </p>
        <p>The meal is still eaten regularly today but as times change and the cost of living increases
            while time to cook lowers. The meal is not eaten as traditionally as it once was. Nevertheless this recipe should help you to make it quick and easy.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2-3 large potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>3-4 carrots, scrubbed and trimmed</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>100ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche</li>
        <li>½ a small bunch tarragon, leaves picked and chopped</li>
        <li>200g (frozen or doubled podded) broad beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Put the chicken in a medium roasting tin, and remove any string. Squeeze half the lemon over the skin and put the lemon half in the cavity with the bay leaf. Season inside and out. Rub 1 tbsp of oil over the skin and transfer to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 and roast for 40-50 minutes or until cooked through. Check by inserting a knife into the meat between the leg and breast, the juices should run clear.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in salted water for 15 minutes until just tender throughout without falling apart. Drain well and leave to steam dry.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a shallow tray above the chicken for a few minutes, then gently lower the potatoes into the hot fat, and spoon over the oil. Add the carrots to the tray. Season well and roast above the chicken for 40 minutes or until golden and crisp, tossing halfway through.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the chicken is cooked, remove to a platter, cover loosely in foil and leave to rest for 15 minutes. While the chicken is resting, put the shallot into the tray with the chicken juices, and cook over a medium heat (transfer to a frying pan if your roasting tin doesn’t work on the hob). Fry for 6-8 minutes or until translucent. Stir in the mustard and stock. Simmer until reduced by half, then stir in the crème fraîche and bring to a bubble. Stir in the tarragon and broad beans, season with salt and pepper, and a squeeze of lemon. Cook until the broad beans are tender.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Carve the chicken and serve with the roast potatoes, carrots, and a spoonful of the broad bean and tarragon sauce. Leftovers will keep, chilled, for two to three days.</li>
    </ol>
